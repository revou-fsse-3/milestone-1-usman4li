Penmanship Print is in response to the many requests I
have read from teachers looking for a freeware font with
printing guides.

I have sacrificed the Grave symbol (`) for a blank guide. 

This font is freeware. Distribute it freely. Please
include this file with the font.

You may not make money from the sale of Penmanship Print
without first purchasing my permission. Contact me at
rchrdd@hotmail.com.

Thanks Enjoy ;)
